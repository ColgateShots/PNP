# PNP
folder meshing:
  physical.xdmf: should represent shape of BC of regular solver

Cylindrical solver:
  simplitic solver to implement Cylindrical coordinates
 
Solver meshed:
  can import xdmf, no plotting yet (reshaping issue)
  
Solver:
  will be updated with xdmf and cylindrical coordinates
